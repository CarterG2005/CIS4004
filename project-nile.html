        <p>
            Project Nile is a Java-based, event-driven application simulating an enterprise inventory and shopping cart system. 
            It allows users to search for items, manage stock, and process transactions while logging activity for audit purposes.
            Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in object-oriented programming, GUI design with Swing, file handling, 
            and exception management. I also strengthened my understanding of software development principles and applying 
            real-world business logic in a functional program.
